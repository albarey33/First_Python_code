Following instructions in: 
https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/publishing/

Include a link to your new GitHub repo in your projectâ€™s README file so people who just have the project distribution know where to find it.

If this is a brand new repo, clone it to your local machine and start working:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/albarey33/projectpython001
```

https://github.com/albarey33/First_Python_code

######Or, if you already have a project Git repo, add your new GitHub repo as a remote:

######$ cd <projectname>
######$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<projectname>
######$ git push --tags
